### JQuery Web App

This is a cool web app I made using JavaScript and the JQuery library in Week 2 at Lighthouse. It's a quick "To Do" List which allows the user to add items to the list and then click them once they're done, to make them disappear. 

Please...please...you don't all have to stand up at once.
